## 🧠 Approach & Methodology
<br>

### 1) Data Understanding & Cleaning
<br>
Actions performed:
- Imported raw CSV (~75K records)
- Fixed incorrect date formats (**DD-MM-YYYY → Date format**)
- Standardized important categorical fields:
  - product
  - issue
  - company response
- Removed:
  - duplicates
  - null/blank entries
  - inconsistent category labels
- Created a dedicated **Date Table** to support:
  - Monthly trends
  - Seasonality
  - Year-over-year (YoY) measures
<br>
(As per dashboard documentation.) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
<br>

### 2) Data Modelling
<br>
A clean **Star Schema** was implemented:
- **Fact Table:** Financial Complaints
- **Dimension Table:** Date Table
<br>

Relationship:
- One-to-many relationship: **Date Table[Date] → Complaints[Date Received]**
<br>

Benefits:
- Accurate filter propagation
- Better performance
- Strong time intelligence foundation
<br>
(As shown in dashboard explanation.) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
<br>

### 3) DAX Measures (Metrics Layer)
<br>
Key DAX measures created:
- Total Complaints
- Timely Response %
- Disputed Rate %
- Resolved at No Cost %
- In-Progress Complaints
- YOY Complaint Change %
<br>

Common DAX patterns used:
- `CALCULATE`
- `SUM`
- `DIVIDE`
- Date intelligence using Date Table
- `DATEADD`
- `FILTER`
<br>
(Confirmed in project summary PDF.) :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
<br>

### 4) Visualization & Storytelling
<br>
Visual components included:
- KPI Cards (executive summary layer)
- Monthly trend chart (seasonality tracking)
- Complaints by Issue (bar chart)
- Complaints by State (US map / hotspot analysis)
- Complaints by Product (tree map / distribution)
- Consumer Disputed % (donut chart)
- Interactive slicers by channels:
  - Email
  - Fax
  - Phone
  - Postal Mail
  - Referral
  - Web
<br>
(As per dashboard visuals list.) :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## 🧩 Dashboard Features (What Business Can Answer)
<br>

✅ Leadership can instantly answer:
- Are complaints rising or falling YoY?
- Which issues generate the most complaints?
- Which products are risk-heavy in customer dissatisfaction?
- Which states show higher complaint concentration?
- Are we responding on time?
- Are customers disputing resolutions despite timely response?
- How many complaints are still open / in progress?
<br>

## 🔎 Key Insights (Findings)
<br>

Based on the dashboard analysis:
<br>

### 📈 Complaint Trend & Growth
- Complaint volume increased **YoY by ~14.33%**
- Indicates growing dissatisfaction OR increased service usage / reporting frequency
<br>

### ⏱ Timely Response vs Dispute Gap (Quality issue)
- **98.05%** complaints received timely response
- But **9.71%** cases were disputed by consumers  
✅ This implies: **SLA met ≠ Resolution quality / fairness**
<br>

### 💸 Resolution Efficiency
- **84.50%** complaints were resolved at **no cost**
- Suggests strong non-monetary resolution effectiveness
<br>

### 🧾 Issue-Level Pain Points (Top Drivers)
Highest complaint contributors:
- **Managing an account (~8.8K)**
- **Deposits & withdrawals (~6.1K)**
- Trouble during payment process (~3.5K)
- Struggling to pay mortgage (~3.4K)
- Problem with purchase shown on statement (~3.3K)
- Billing disputes (~3.2K)
<br>

Managing Accounts + Deposits/Withdrawals alone contribute **~20%** of complaints.
<br>

### 🧨 Product Risk Concentration
Top product concentration:
- **Credit card ~25.30%**
- **Checking/Savings account ~17.85%**
Combined: **~43%** complaint concentration
<br>

### 🌍 Geographic Hotspots
- Certain states show disproportionate complaints
- Indicates potential operational inefficiencies, vendor/service gaps, or region-specific customer experience issues
<br>
